The First ``Computer Bug''.  Moth found trapped between points at
Relay #70, Panel F, of the Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator while it was
being tested at Harvard University, 9 September 1947.  The operators
affixed the moth to the computer log, with the entry: ``First actual
case of bug being found''.  They put out the word that they had
``debugged'' the machine, thus introducing the term ``debugging a
computer program''.  In 1988, the log, with the moth still taped by
the entry, was in the Naval Surface Warfare Center Computer Museum at
Dahlgren, Virginia.
