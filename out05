 7. Write a complete program in Perl that reads in words from all of
    the filenames specified in @ARGV, and after end of file of the
    last file, prints out each word, one per line, sorted
    lexicographically, with each word followed by a count of the
    number of times it occurred.  Exit status is 0 for success and 1
    if any file could not be opened.  Print suitable error messaages
    for files that could not be opened.  If no files are specified,
    read the standard input.  Do not use the <> operator.  Use /\w+/
    to match words or /\W+/ to split delimiters.  If @ARGV is empty,
    use "-" (standard input).  [5pt]

6. Perl.  Write a program which prints out the file size, modification
   time, and filename for each file mentioned in @ARGV.  Hints:  The
   result of the stat function is an array where $stat[7] is the file
   size and $stat[9] is the modification time.  Use the strftime
   format "%b %e %H:%S" to print out the time.  Print a suitable error
   message if @stat has length 0.  [3pt]
