    if any line does not have an equal sign, but ignore any line

1. Define gcd which uses Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest
   common divisor for two integers $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.  The C version
   is given.  Example:  $ roman gcd ( 111 , 259 ) = roman gcd ( 111 ,
   148 ) = roman gcd ( 111 , 37 ) = roman gcd ( 74 , 37 ) = roman gcd
   ( 37 , 37 ) = 37 $.
      int gcd (int x, int y) {
         while (x != y) if (x > y) x -= y; else y -= x;
         return x;
      }

    (a) Scheme.  Use tail recursion.  [2pt]
        Example call:  (define g (gcd 111 259)).

    (b) Ocaml.  Use tail recursion and curried format.  [2pt]
        Example call:  let d = gcd 111 259;;.

    (c) Smalltalk.  Extend class Integer with a keyword method gcd:.
        Use a loop.  [2pt]
        Example call:  g := 111 gcd: 259.

    (d) Perl.  Use a loop or tail recursion.  Properly prototype the
        function.  [2pt]
        Example call:  $g = gcd 111, 259;

    (e) Prolog.  [2pt]
        Example call:  gcd( 111, 259, G ).

2. \lambda-calculus.  Given the expression in the \lambda-calculus
   shown at the top of each box, show the derivation order to the
   number 25 for each of normal order and applicative order
   evaluation.  [1pt]

   |                                                           |                                                            |

10. Perl.  Write a program that reads files mentioned on the command
   line, and reads STDIN if none.  Do not open files -- use the <>
   operator.  At the end of the last file, print each word followed by
   the number of times it appears.  Print the words lexicographically.
   A word is any sequence of characters that matches m/\w+/.  An
   example is given.  [2pt]
