 5. A closure is:
    (A) A special field of a structure or class used to point at a
        base class when implementing shared multiple inheritance.
    (B) A special type declaration in Ocaml used to distinguish sum
        types from product types.
    (C) A structure on the heap, used to hold variables of an outer
        function when referenced by an inner function.
    (D) A table used to dynamically dispatch virtual functions in an
        object-oriented environment.
