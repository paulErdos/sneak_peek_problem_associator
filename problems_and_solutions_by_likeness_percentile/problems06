    this order:  a function, a unit, and a list.  A single result is
    returned such that the function is applied to the unit and the car

    list is sent in on each recursive call.  It is tail recursive.

   integer $n$, if it is repeatedly replaced by $ n / 2 $ when even
   and $ 3 n + 1 $ when odd, it eventually converges on the integer

   return a list of all integers starting from the argument and ending
   with 1.  The inner function produces the list in the reverse order,
   but the outer function reverses the list.  Some Scheme functions to
